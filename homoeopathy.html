          <p> <span>Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann</span>  — a distinguished physician, linguist, scientist, and translator — is recognized as the founder of Homeopathy. During his practice of conventional medicine, he became deeply concerned that the treatments of his time often caused more harm than healing. Choosing integrity over profession, he left medical practice and devoted himself to translation and research. It was during this scholarly work that he encountered insights that inspired the revolutionary principles of healing we now know as Homeopathy.</p>

              Hahnemann was a good translator. While translating Cullen’s

              Cullen has noted, “Peruvian Bark can be used successfully in the
              treatment of intermittent fever because it is bitter and it has
              tonic effect on stomach”.Hahnemann was dissatisfied with it and
              started experimenting it on himself.
